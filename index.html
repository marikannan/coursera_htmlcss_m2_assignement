      <p class="sectionParagraph">millet pongal ,sharing another millet or korralu recipe that is filling, healthy, protein rich and diabetic friendly too. This recipe can also be used to make millet pongal for babies. Use equal amount of white rice and millets, minus the seasoning ingredients like cumin,pepper corn, curry leaves. Fry tiny pinch of grated ginger in a tsp of ghee. I have used hulled foxtail millet, called as thinai, korralu or navane. You can use any other millet to make this pongal much the same way I made this. But for babies, I have no idea if any other millet can be used.</p>
